To get the timer to work we had to do a fair amount of changes to it. Most of the changes are in the second_challenge_controller, but we also changed the gate_controller.py so that it gave the time every 
1 second so that we could see our time. We wish that it was set up this way to begin with rather than every 8 seconds and that it would let us know our times every time we finished a lap.
